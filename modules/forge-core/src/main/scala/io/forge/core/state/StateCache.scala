/** §4 / §11.0 — local rebuildable state cache for a feature's `Feature` projection.
  *
  * `manifest.json` (§4) is the committed source of truth; the action log (§19) is the canonical runtime record. The
  * `Feature` projected by `Feature.foldEvents(initial, log)` is what the cache stores — a serialised aggregate of the
  * §6.1 projections (state, session ids, cost totals, branch-protection epoch, design-feedback round).
  *
  * Writes are atomic at the filesystem layer (temp file + fsync + `os.move`) per the §11.5 "Write via temp file +
  * os.move" rule; a reader observing the file always sees either the previous committed view or the new one.
  *
  * `verifyAgainstLog` is the §11.0 step 4 entry point: it rebuilds the `Feature` from the manifest + log and either
  * confirms the cache or replaces it.

  /** Read the on-disk cache. Returns `None` when the file is absent (a fresh feature, or post-`forge rebuild-state`
    * deletion) **or when the cache is present but unreadable** (truncated, partial flush, uPickle decode failure). The
    * §4 invariant says the cache is rebuildable from `manifest.json` + the action log, so an unreadable cache is never
    * authoritative — callers that need authoritative state run [[verifyAgainstLog]], which distinguishes
    * `cache_missing` from `cache_unreadable` in the appended `harness.cache_invalidated` reason.
    *
    * Does **not** validate against the manifest or the action log — that's [[verifyAgainstLog]]'s job. A `load` after a
    * crash may surface a stale cache; callers that need authoritative state run [[verifyAgainstLog]] (or call
    * [[RebuildState.run]] directly).

    * On a missing cache, an unreadable cache, or a value mismatch: runs the full [[RebuildState.run]] pipeline
