/** §6 / §17 / PR-B B4 — input alphabet of `Fsm.transition(feature, event)`.
  *
  * v1.2 §17 names `FsmEvent` but doesn't enumerate it; PR-B B4 settles the variants. The §11.x cross-reference on each
  * variant names the lifecycle step that produces it; PR-C implements the corresponding transition rule.
  *
  * Naming note: B4's sketch named the design-review-result variant `DesignReviewVerdict`, but that clashes with the
  * `io.forge.core.review.DesignReviewVerdict` ADT carried as the `verdict` field. Renamed to `DesignReviewReceived`
  * (matching the past-tense convention of `PrSnapshotUpdated`, `BranchCreated`, `Merged`, etc.). The §4 carry-forward
  * entry S2-2 captures the variant list as the de-facto contract.
  *
  * Provider neutrality: events that carry reviewer verdicts use the core-side summary types in `io.forge.core.review`.
  * `forge-agents` projects its rich `DesignReview` / `PrReview` / `RefineResult` shapes into those summaries at the
  * Slice-4 wiring call site; `forge-core` never sees the raw reviewer payload.
